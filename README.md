This is a repo for generating static pages using jekyll theme from [LeNPaul](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange). I intend to use this to log my learnings as blogs to keep a track and potentially could help someone to learn a thing or two for themselves from these blogs.

Topics I will be focusing on learning and documenting in these blogs are:
1. AI
2. Database Management systems (SQL)
3. Visualisation tools such as powerBI, Grafana
4. Python (Mostly focused on libraries for Datascience, AI)
5. Machine Learning Operations (MLOP's)
6. Cloud Management tools mostly AWS
7. Also, some interesting topics that I learned while doing my projects.

Note: There is no order in the learning. Currently I am learning AWS from a course from [mlops club](https://mlops-club.org/), so expect more posts related to AWS.
