Hey! I'm Jayadeep; I have recently finished my master's. I am enthusiastic about working with data, specifically data science and MLOps. I like to build models and E2E pipelines to understand the data better and find hidden patterns. I got the first exposure to this ever-growing field during my master's, where I got the opportunity to learn about image processing. As a student with a mechanical background, I was genuinely interested and wanted to explore more in depth. I have taken several other subjects related to computer vision and deep learning during my master's. I started doing projects and internships related to the application of machine learning concepts in production, combining both my knowledge in the mechanical and machine learning fields. By the time I finished my master's, I was more oriented towards data science and MLOps, having completed several certification courses and bootcamps. 

Right now, I am actively applying for a job in the fields mentioned above. Knowing this is an actively developing field, it is important to keep myself updated on the latest developments. Recently, I have started learning cloud services using Amazon Web Services (AWS). So, I intend to use this blogging platform to document everything I learn every day. Also, hopefully, someone reading these blogs could learn a thing or two.

### About the blogs

Topics I will be focusing on learning and documenting in these blogs are:
1. AI
2. Database Management systems (SQL)
3. Visualisation tools such as powerBI, Grafana
4. Python (Mostly focused on libraries for Datascience, AI)
5. Machine Learning Operations (MLOP's)
6. Cloud Management tools mostly AWS
7. Also, some interesting topics that I learned while doing my projects. 

These are not ordered or prioritised in any order. However, you can expect a pattern that each blog matures as I build on the previous blogs.
