Hi there! Welcome to my first blog. As, I am currently applying for a full time position and working parttime, I find little time to learn and document everything. I expect to maintain consisteny in these blogs in the coming days and months. I have intermediate knowledge about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, SQL, Python, PowerBI and other tools. So, Whoever reading these blogs are expected to have little basic understanding of these concepts.

Todays date is 3rd october. And start of the first day in my learning and blogging journey.
